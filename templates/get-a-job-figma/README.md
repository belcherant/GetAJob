# GetAJob — Figma to React Template

This folder is a template that contains an initial React + Vite scaffold (JavaScript) with plain CSS and placeholder pages for the Figma -> React conversion.

What is included
- Vite React scaffold (package.json added previously, index.html, src/)
- Simple routing (react-router-dom) and placeholder components
- Plain CSS file (src/index.css) and simple Header/Footer

Next steps to complete conversion
1. Confirm the Figma file is accessible (make sure the file is shareable via link or invite me).
2. Export assets (SVGs, images, fonts) from Figma and add them to `src/assets/`.
3. Convert each Figma page into a React component (one component per page) and implement responsive CSS, hover states, color changes, and interactions.
4. Optimize assets, add README details, and push incremental commits for review.

How to run locally

cd templates/get-a-job-figma
npm install
npm run dev

Notes
- This template uses JavaScript for faster iteration. If you prefer TypeScript, I can convert the project.
- You asked for direct push to `main/templates`; these files are added under `templates/get-a-job-figma` on main.

Please add the Figma file view access and I will continue converting all pages into React components and push incremental commits for your review.
